Received message. I can search for that. Based on the web results, the relayer in IBC protocol may face some challenges such as latency, reliability, and incentives . For example, a relayer may experience delays or failures in relaying packets due to network congestion, faulty hardware, or malicious attacks. A relayer may also need to pay fees to submit packets to the destination chain, which may not be covered by the rewards or incentives from the source chain. A relayer may also be exposed to MEV attacks if they relay packets that contain valuable information such as price feeds or oracle data.

May I say L2 chains are nonautonomous chains to some class?
Sent message. May I say L2 chains are nonautonomous chains to some class?
I’m not sure what you mean by nonautonomous chains. Do you mean chains that are not independent or self-governing? If so, then I think it depends on the type of L2 chain and how it interacts with L1. Some L2 chains may be more autonomous than others, depending on their design and implementation. For example, some L2 chains may have their own validators, consensus rules, and state machines, while others may rely on L1 for these aspects. Some L2 chains may also have more or less control over their own upgrades, governance, and security. Therefore, I don’t think it’s accurate to say that all L2 chains are nonautonomous, but rather that they have different degrees of autonomy.

I mean if L2 chains' finality depends on L1, then they are not independent.
Sent message. I mean if L2 chains' finality depends on L1, then they are not independent.
I see. Well, as I said before, not all L2 chains’ finality depends on L1. Some L2 chains may have their own finality guarantees that are independent of L1. However, even if an L2 chain’s finality depends on L1, it may still have some degree of independence in other aspects, such as its functionality, scalability, and innovation. Therefore, I think it’s more nuanced than simply saying that L2 chains are not independent if their finality depends on L1. There may be trade-offs and benefits involved in choosing different types of L2 solutions.

Is the degree of L2 chains' dependence one of the reasons to make L2 chains' sequencer permissioned? I mean as L2 chains are not fully dependent, a single sequencer or some permissioned sequencer would reduce the sequrity risk of L2 chains.

Received message. I can search for that. Based on the web results, the degree of L2 chains' dependence on L1 may not be the main reason to make L2 chains' sequencer permissioned. Rather, some L2 chains may use a permissioned sequencer to improve the user experience by reducing latency and increasing throughput. A permissioned sequencer can order transactions faster and more efficiently than a permissionless sequencer that may have conflicting or inconsistent views of the state. However, this also introduces a trade-off between speed and decentralization, as a permissioned sequencer can potentially censor or manipulate transactions. Some L2 chains are working on decentralizing their sequencer network in the future to address this issue.
